    <!-- We put the  java script code at the end of the body, since the server reads the file from top to bottom and if it tries to execute the 
    js code at the start it causes a bad user experience due to long loading times before they can see anything-->
    <script>
        //this is a comment, does not get executed
        console.log('Hello World');
